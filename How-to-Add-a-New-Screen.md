# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png) How to add a New Screen

It’s time to add a new screen. You’ll start by working on the user interface created from [How to create a New Project](./How-to-Use-New-Project-Wizard).

A UI is like a picture book. Complex book has many pages to communicate its message, similarily, a more complex UI may has more than one Screen to provide appropriate communication to the user. Pages in composer are called Screens. 

In this guide we will create a screen to display a Text, an Image, and a Button. The button will be used allow the user to transition from screen1 back to the screen0.

## Add a Screen

The Screens pane is used to create a new screen.

1. Select **Screens** tab to view the available screens.

You will notice that there is one screen0 in the list. We need to add another screen.

2.  Add a new screen to the list of screens. Select the **+** icon on the String manager. Alternatively, you can select **File -> New** from the menu. This will add a new screen named **Screen1** to the project.
