# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png) Application Migration

A collection of application migration tutorials are provided with MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite to help users move applications created in earlier versions of MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite to MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite 3. 

The applications are part of MPLAB Harmony distributions. Visit the [GFX](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/tree/master/apps) and [GFX Apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx_apps/tree/master/apps) for more information on Harmony 3 applications.

MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite 3 introduces new features and APIs that you can take advantage of in your apps, as well as new Harmony configuration changes. Customers are typically motivated to take advantage of functionality that is new. This document gives you an overview of the steps to migrate an existing application on the new version of the framework. 

If you created your app using an earlier version of the MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite, you can upgrade to the latest version MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite.

Note: To target a new application on the frame see [Quickstart](Application-QuickStart).


### Migration Benefits
* New technology adoption
* Better Device Support
* Faster Development
* Improved Runtime Performance

Note: some changes in the MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite require changes to your code.
