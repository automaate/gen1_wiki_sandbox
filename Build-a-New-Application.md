# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png) Build a New Application

A collection of guides are provided with MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite to help users create new applications. These guides were created using Microchip [supported development boards](Supported-Development-Boards). Although these guides run on Microchip boards, customers are free to reference any board and application for their custom designs.

Note: Complete applications are part of each MPLAB Harmony distribution. Visit the [quickstart apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/tree/master/apps) and [feature apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx_apps/tree/master/apps) for more information.
