# ![Microchip Technology](https://github.com/automaate/GFX_sandbox/blob/master/images/mhgs.png) Create a Display Driver for a 3rd-Party Display Controller

A collection of guides are provided with MPLAB速 Harmony Graphics Suite to help users create display drivers. These guides were created using Microchip [supported development boards](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/wiki/Supported-Development-Boards). Although these guides run on Microchip boards, customers are free to reference any board and controller for their custom drivers.

Note: Complete drivers for our productized boards are part of each MPLAB Harmony distribution. Visit the [quickstart apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/tree/master/apps) and [feature apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx_apps/tree/master/apps) for more information.
