# Review

You have successfully created an application using MPLAB Harmony v3 on Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0. Your application used all the fundamental elements that go in building a graphics application. Your application successfully rendered a UI to the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module. The application also took user from the display module.

In this application, you used MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to configure Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0. You used MHC to add and connect components. You used Pin Configurator to set up the pins for display and maXTouch controller.

# Summary

This guide provided you training of configuring and using all the fundamental components needed to build a graphics application on a Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board with MPLAB Harmony v3 Framework. As a next step, you may customize this application and reconfigure some of the components used in this tutorial. You could also add new components (PLIBs, etc.) to enhance this application to realize your end application.
