# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png)  Application Quickstarts

A collection of driver quickstart tutorials are provided with MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite to help users understand and create drivers quickly. Some of these guides were created using Microchip [supported development boards](Supported-Development-Boards)  while others were created using a mixture of 3rd-Party development board solutions.

Although some of these guides run on Microchip boards, customers are free to reference our solutions to enable their custom designs.

Note: Complete applications are part of each MPLAB Harmony distribution. Visit the [quickstart apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/tree/master/apps) and [feature apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx_apps/tree/master/apps) for more information.
