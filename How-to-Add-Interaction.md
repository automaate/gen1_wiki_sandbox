# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png) How to Add Interactions

It’s time to add interactions. You’ll start by working on the user interface created from [How to add a Scheme](./How-to-Add-Scheme).

It’s time to business logic behavior. You’ll start by working on the user interface created from Add Screen guide.

Events and business logic add behavior to your application. 

In this guide, we will add a event to respond to a release event on the qsButton widget. In our app code we will add logic to transition to screen1. 

We will also add an event to respond to a release event on the Exit button. In our app code we will add logic to transition from screen1 back to screen0.

Lastly, we will add an event to respond to a notification that screen1 has showed itself.
