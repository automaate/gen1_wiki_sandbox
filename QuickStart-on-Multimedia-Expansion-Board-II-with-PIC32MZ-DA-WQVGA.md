## Observations

You observed that the application displayed the home screen. You were able to change screens and control widgets.

## Review

You have successfully created an application using MPLAB Harmony v3 on PIC32MZ DA WQVGA. Your application used all the fundamental elements that go in building a graphics application. Your application successfully rendered a UI to the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module. The application also took user from the display module.

In this application, you used MPLAB® Harmony Configurator (MHC) to configure PIC32MZ DA WQVGA. You used MHC to add and connect components. You used Pin Configurator to set up the pins for display and maxTouch controller.

## Summary

This guide provided you training of configuring and using all the fundamental components needed to build a graphics application on a Multimedia Expansion Board II with PIC32MZ DA WQVGA using MPLAB Harmony v3 Framework. As a next step, you may customize this application and reconfigure some of the components used in this tutorial. You could also add new components (PLIBs, etc.) to enhance this application to realize your end application.
