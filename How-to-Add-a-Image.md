# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png) How to add an Image

It’s time to add a new image. You’ll start by working on the user interface created from [How to Add Background](./How-to-Add-a-Background).

User interfaces are more engaging with Images. Images are more than just pictures; they have the power to make your design compelling and understandable. In this tutorial we will first add an Image asset and then a Image Widget to display the image assets.

Adding an image is a two part process. First you have to upload the Image asset and then create a Widget for display. In this guide we will use a Image Widget.

We guide you through this process in the following guides:

* [How to Add Image Asset](./How-to-Add-Image-Asset)
* [How to Add Image Widget](./How-to-Add-Image-Widget)
* [How to add a Button Widget](./How-to-Add-Button-Widget).
