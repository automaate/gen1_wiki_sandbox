# ![Microchip Technology](images/mhgs.png) How to Apply a Scheme

It’s time to apply a Scheme. You’ll start by working on the user interface created from [How to add a Scheme](./How-to-Add-Scheme).

## Apply Scheme

The Toolbox pane appears at the top right of the screen designer area on the right side of Legato composer. If you don’t see the Toolbox pane, click **Window -> Reset Windows** in the menu bar.

1.  Drag a Label widget from the Toolbox to your screen. Use the Object Editor to set its exact size and location. Set **Position** to (120,130) and **Size** to (263,50). Set the button scheme to **LabelScheme**. Set its **String**  to **LabelWidgetString**. 


The result of the LabelWidgetString addition is illustrated below:

# Next Step

In this guide, you learned how to apply a scheme created in a previous guide to a LabelWidget. We also learned that a LabelWidget has knowledge of a Scheme, but the Scheme has no knowledge of a LabelWidget. This allows the scheme to be used by multiple widgets. At this point, you’re ready add interactions.
Go to the next tutorial in this series: [How to Add Interaction](./How-to-Add-Interaction)
